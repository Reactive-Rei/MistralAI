## Node.js Overview

Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a web browser. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine and is widely used for building scalable network applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model.

### Key Features:

- Event-driven: Uses events to handle asynchronous operations.
- Non-blocking I/O: Efficient handling of multiple connections.
- Single-threaded: Uses a single thread to manage connections via event looping.

### Common Uses:

- Web servers
- APIs
- Real-time applications (e.g., chat apps)
- Command-line tools

## Embeddings and Vector Databases

Embeddings are crucial in machine learning for translating data into numerical formats that models can understand. For tasks like similarity search, embeddings are stored in vector databases.

### Key Features of Vector Databases:

- High-Dimensional Indexing: Efficient indexing for fast retrieval.
- Similarity Search: Finds vectors similar to a query vector.
- Scalability: Handles large volumes of data.

### Popular Vector Databases:

- Pinecone: Optimized for high-dimensional vector search.
- Chroma
- Supabase: Open-source solution.

We will use Supabase to manage our vector database.

### Running RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation)

- Write code to query a vector/embedding and generate responses using Mistral AI models.

### Creating AI Agents

- Implement function calling to enable AI agents to interact with the world on the user's behalf.

## Conclusion

Mistral AI provides robust and scalable AI solutions tailored for various machine learning tasks. By following this guide, you'll be equipped to integrate and utilize Mistral AI models in your JavaScript projects effectively.
